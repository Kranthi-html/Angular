From #273 to #297:
Worked with dynamic route parameters, extracting them via observables.
Worked with nested routes and accessed route data from inside nested routes.
Loaded data based on route parameters in child routes.
Split route definitions across multiple files.
Set query parameters and extracted query parameters via inputs and observables, then performed data manipulations.
Accessed route data in components, then set up the title of the page both statically and dynamically.
Used Route Guards to activate and deactivate routes by controlling the route flow.
