Section 25
Hierarchical Dependency Injector: Angular's dependency injector allows services to be provided at various levels (e.g., AppModule or component level), affecting their availability to other components.

Service Sharing: If a service is provided at the AppModule level, the same instance is available to all components. If provided at the AppComponent, only that component and its children share that instance.

Injection Flexibility: Services can be injected into other services, enhancing service management.

Instance Uniqueness: A service provided at the lowest level (e.g., a single component) will have its own instance, which can override instances from higher levels.
Section26
Service Instance Sharing: It reiterates that services can be provided at different levels (e.g., AppModule or specific components) and emphasizes the implications of where a service is provided for its accessibility.

State Management: If provided at a higher level (like the AppModule), the same service instance is shared across the entire application, aiding in consistent state management.

Component-Level Provisioning: If a service is provided at the AppComponent level, it restricts access to that component and its children, not allowing access to instances provided at lower levels.

Injecting Services into Other Services: The lecture highlights the flexibility of injecting services into other services, which enhances management capabilities within your Angular application.
